The rules for Blackjack are here, it’s a relatively simple game. Your implementation just needs to give the "hit" and "stand" options to the player (no betting), feel free to figure out what UI you prefer, as long as the user understands what is happening and can play multiple games.

#### Languages used:

###### Game Rules
The aim of the game is to draw cards totalling as close to 21 as possible, without going over. You draw two cards, then can choose whether to stand (settle for your current cards) or hit (draw another card). If your score is over 21 then you bust, if you get 21 you win blackjack!
